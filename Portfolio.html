          <h3>Fantail</h3>
          <p>One of my favourite bird paintings I created in 2022. <br />A Fantail/Piwakawaka painted in acrylic on A5 catridge paper. I really wanted to capture in this painting how this fantail was mid flight. This is because all my other bird paintings have been perched on a branch or standing (the Heron).</p>

          <h3>Tui</h3>
          <p>This Tui is painted in acrylic on A5 cartridge paper. I love how vibrant the blue on the Tui's wings are and the extra pops of colour from the flowers on the branch.</p>

          <h3>Kingfisher</h3>
          <p>This Kingfisher has been painted with acrylics on A5 cartridge paper. I'm very pleased with the outcome of this painting, as the feathers, and branch the kingfisher is perched on, has good detail. </p>

          <h3>Heron</h3>
          <p>A Heron painted with acrylics on A5 cartridge paper. I decided to not include the feet and bottom half of the legs in this piece, because I wanted to focus on the details in the feathers. Interpret the lack of lower leg as if the Heron is standing in a pond.</p>

          <h3>Docked boat</h3>
          <p>This old metal docked boat, with seaweed covering the rope attached, and sitting in the still water, is one of my favourite watercolour paintings to date! This painting has been done with watercolour paint on A5 Watercolour paper.</p>

          <h3>Mandala map of New Zealand</h3>
          <p>This is a fineliner illustration that I have done of the map of New Zealand, filled with a mandala pattern, and drawn on A5 cartridge paper. I love drawing mandala patterns as it is rather therapeutic. I also always find it fun to draw intricate patterns, as it is something different different to all my paintings.</p>

There's a dark night sky, with sparkling stars and a moon, and oversized salmon coloured roses plus a large branch that form the shape of a wreath, which all elements are placed within." /></a>
          <h3>Loe Lee inspired whimsical illustration </h3>
          <p>This is an acrylic painting of a whimsical scene on A4 cartridge paper. This illustration was one aspect of a project for my Illustration course, in my second semester of my second year of uni (2023). For this project we had to pick an illustrator, and create an illustration that was inspired by our chosen illustrator. We were also tasked with creating a presentation about our chosen illustrator. I really enjoyed this project, as I chose to try out a different art style to my own. I love the whimsical style of Loe Lee and took influence from her, and applied the same whimsical style to my own illustration, utilising vibrant colours.</p>

Then picture teal, royal purple, and coral pink colours darted across the window display. There is a summer sign that has an arrow pointing inside, various different tropical leaves, as well as a silver fern and kowhai plant. Then picture rippled water in teal in the lower quarter of the two glass window panels, and standing in the water on the right is a coral pink flamingo, with purple line work." /></a>
          <h3>Illustration project for Coral</h3>
          <p>This is a project from my Ilustration course, that I did in my second year of university, in semester two. I'm still developing my digital drawing skills, but this project was a great oppurtunity to do so! This was a partner project, where myself and my assignment partner had to each be the 'client' and th 'ilustrator'. My partner created a swimwear brand for women called Coral, who were launching there new summer swimwear collection, and were in need of an illustration for there window display. As you'll see on this site I draw/paint a lot of birds, dogs, and landscapes, but for this project it was so fun to branch out and create a fun tropical illustration for Coral. This illustration is created in illustrator and uses a limited CMYK colour palette, which was a challenge, however I'm very pleased with the outcome and the way I utilised each of the three colours to create dimnesion within the piece.</p>

          <a href="images/fulls/Stewy.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/thumbs/Stewy.jpg" alt="Imagine a picture book wiht a watercolour, and coloured pencil brown, and black sausage dog running a long a watercolour beach. There is a large title above the dog saying 'The Adventures of Stewy'." /></a>
          <h3>The Adventures of Stewy picture book</h3>
          <p>I created this fun and light-hearted picture book about a dog called Stewy for my Visual Narratives course at Victoria University, in my second year. I had a lot of fun with this childrens picture book, and am considering creating more picture books like this one. This book takes the reader on a sausage dogs mischevious journey to the beach, whilst his owners were at work. Stewy gets up to all sorts of antics, including stealing a sandwich from picnic-goers! This picture book was heavily inspired by my love for sausage dogs. I wanted to take the reader on a journey of what I would imagine a sausage dog could get up to if he had the chance for freedom (no owners controlling where he goes). </p>

          <h3>Tom and Jerry coded phenakistoscope</h3>
          <p>This Tom and Jerry inspired phenakistoscope was a piece of work I completed during my creative coding first year course at Victoria University. I had no prior coding experience prior to this class, but with a lot of time and effort put into each project and learning code, I feel very proud of what I was able to achieve. This project was my favourite of the three projects completed in the course!</p>

There are small blue icons accompanying the text for each section going over a co-design approach to tackiling plastic waste. This text and icons are placed in the gaps in the plastic bag squiggle. There's a reasearch, understanding, development, construction, and reflection section. " /></a>
          <h3>Plastic waste poster</h3>
          <p>This was a piece from my third Co-Design project from my first semester of 2023 – my second year of study. The purpose of this poster is to visually display a co-design approach to tackling plastic waste within highly populated cities within New Zealand.</p>

The middle plastic typeface is illustrated to look like fishing net. There is some text below the large words saying plastic." /></a>
          <h3>Poster on plastic waste</h3>
          <p>In the first semester of my second year at university, I took a typography course. This poster communicating the negative effects of Plastic Waste, was my favourtie of the three assignments. For this poster I wanted to communicate visually how plastic pollution comes in many forms – hence the plastic bottle and netting typeface – and how we must take action to stop plastic pollution and climate change. Sustainability is one of my highest values, therefore I like to communicate this value in many of my posts. </p>

          <a href="images/fulls/TrainApp.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/thumbs/TrainApp.jpg" alt="Imagine a poster displaying a new train ticket app called Easy Go. There's a ticket barcode screen displayed on a phoen mock-up and an old ten-trip ticket beside it. There's an illustration of a location symbol and a train down the bottom of the page, and text saying 'thinkk quick, think simple, think Easy Go' in the top left. The Easy Go logo is in the top right. The poster is white and two shades of green – light and medium green." /></a>
          <h3>Proposed train ticket app</h3>
          <p>I major in communication design and minor in design for social innovation, but I tried my hand at interaction design in my first year of uni, 2022. This was my final project for this course, where I developed a prototype for a train ticket app. The purpose of this app was to make users train experience much easier by implementing an app that stores your train tickets. Once the tickets are bought or uploaded on the app, the tickets on the app can be shown to the ticket collector on the train and scanned to be used. This is the poster portion of the assignment, used to promote the app prototype. This project was down prior to the introduction of snappers on trains in Wellington, therefore was valid at the time, but no longer neccessary as paper train tickets have been discontinued.</p>

          <h3>Woofs of Welly hero shot</h3>
          <p>This hero shot was a part of one of my projects for my first year graphic design course in 2022. Throughout the course we developed a brand that we created, and completed a series of projects developing our brand. This hero shot showcases the essence of my brand, which is a doggy daycare facility. I created merchandise that was also sold at this doggy daycare, that the owners of dogs could purchase for themselves and there dogs. There were also t-shirts created for staff members to wear. I loved the graphic design course and had a lot of fun creating a brand centered around one of my favourite things – dogs – and taught me a lot about branding design. </p>

          <h3>A zine on the lowercase letter 'l'</h3>
          <p>I made this zine for my first typography project during semester one of my second year of university (2023). I'm really happy with the outcome of the zine, especially with the comstraints of a limited colour palette, and being given the lowercase letter l (a suprisingly difficult letter to make interesting). This zine is concertina folded, and there are 3 colours, white, black and blue is a feature colour. The letter l is visualised in multiple medias, paint, charcoal, pen, white chalk, made out of black paper, and pieces of charcoal placed to make the letterform.</p>
